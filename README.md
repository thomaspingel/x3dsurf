# x3dsurf
Create an X3D Elevation Grid from a digital elevation model (DEM)

This was a first-effort attempt at building X3D models in Matlab. It is all but abandoned, but supports simple exports of surfaces from Matlab into X3D. I typically use x3dindexedfaceset.m (to be published soon) instead, since it is more versatile.
